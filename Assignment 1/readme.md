# Assignment 1
##Reflections
The possible reasons I could think of why the man did not die when the woman fired her gun was these:
* She did not hit him.
* He was bulletproof (wearing protective gear)
* Nothing vital was hit
* The gun fired blanks.
* It was not a real gun.

How to tell an alien to brush its teeth:
* Pickup toothpaste.
* Unscrew toothpaste.
* Hold toothpaste over toothbrush brush area and squeeze slightly.
* Pickup the toothbrush.
* Put toothbrush in mouth so that it touches the teeth with the brush area.
* Move toothbrush in circles while touching teeth with the brush area. Make sure that all teeth will be touched on all sides at some point.
* Do the above for two minutes.
* Take the toothbrush out of mouth and spit in the sink.
* Rinse with water.

## Two katas
See code.

## Thoughts:
What was good: 
* Only code what you need. 
* When you make changes, you can see that if all previous steps still work.
* Better code structure

Annoying or difficult:
* Feels like it takes a longer time, though I suspect this is only initially.
* Thinking of things to test, and not just coding the solution.

What surprised you:
* It was very easy to do, once you got into the habit of writing a test first.
* Cleaner code

Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?:
* Yes definitely. I would probably have written the entire converter, tested it with one or two different parameters and be done with it.
